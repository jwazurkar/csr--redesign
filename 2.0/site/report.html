            <article role="article">
                <p><span class="test">Resilience, at its most basic level, refers to an ability to adapt quickly</span> to, or recover from, changes. To GMCR, building a resilient supply chain means not only helping the producers and manufacturers in our supply chain, as well as their employees and wider communities, to adapt to the many challenges they face, but also to prosper over the short and long term. GMCR commits to long-term relationships that sustain healthier communities and create the highest-quality products. Our base of more than 7,000 suppliers is complex, like that of many companies, but it also has a unique dual nature that results from our role as both a maker of beverages from agricultural ingredients and a producer of small appliances.</p>
